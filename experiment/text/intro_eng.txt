For this experiment, you will hear two phrases in French or English, pronounced with different intonations modifying the pitch and speed. 

For each pair, you must use the keyboard to indicate which of the two phrases contains the best example of the given word.

If the first phrase is the best example, press [g]; if it is the second, press [h].

After each response, you will also be asked to estimate your certainty in your choice on a scale from 1 (not at all certain) to 4 (completely certain).
