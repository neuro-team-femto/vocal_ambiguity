For this experiment, you will hear a phrase in French or English, pronounced with different intonations modifying the pitch and speed. 

You must use the keyboard to indicate which of the two indicated words you hear in the phrase by pressing either [g] or [h].

After each response, you will also be asked to estimate your certainty in your choice on a scale from 1 (not at all certain) to 4 (completely certain).
